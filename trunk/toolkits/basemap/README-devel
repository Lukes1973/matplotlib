To make a release:

1) check out a fresh copy from SVN.
2) run python setup.py dist to make the source tarball.
3) run python setupegg.py bdist_egg to make a binary egg.
   (repeat this step on ppc mac, intel mac and windows, for
    python 2.4 and python 2.5).
4) put the *_h.txt boundary files in a tar.gz file
   (basemap-data-hires-X.Y.Z.tar.gz).
