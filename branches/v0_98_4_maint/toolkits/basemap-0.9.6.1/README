**Documentation** 

see basemap.py docstrings.

see scripts in 'examples' directory for example usage.

read the FAQ and/or email the matplotlib-users mailing list if 
you have problems or questions.

**Install**

To install from source, download basemap-X.Y.Z.tar.gz from
the sourceforge download site, unpack,
cd to basemap-X.Y.Z and run 'python setup.py install'.

Binary, double-clickable installers are also provided for MacOS X and
Windows.  The Mac installers have a .dmg file extension, the Windows
installers have a .exe extension. Windows users will probably prefer
s option, since it is non-trivial to build C extensions for python on Windows.

The crude ('c'), low ('l') and intermediate ('i') resolution
boundary data files, plus the 5-minute land/sea mask, are installed
by default. If you need the high ('h') resolution boundary dataset
you can download the files from the sourceforge download site
(basemap-data-hires-X.Y.Z.tar.gz) and manually install them.
To see where basemap expects them to be installed, run
python -c "from matplotlib.toolkits.basemap import basemap_datadir; print basemap_datadir".
