* The fillcontinents method doesn't always do the right thing.  Matplotlib
always tries to fill the inside of a polygon.  Under certain situations,
what is the inside of a coastline polygon can be ambiguous, and the 
outside may be filled instead of the inside.  To trigger this,
run the garp.py example with lon=-71,lat=-33 (Santiago, Chile).
Workaround - mask the land areas with the drawlsmask method instead of
filling the coastline polygons.
