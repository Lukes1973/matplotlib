**Install**

1) run 'python setup.py install' 

for a non-standard install (python setup.py install --home=<dir>,
or python setup.py install --prefix=<dir>), the environment
variable BASEMAP_DATA_PATH must be set to the directory where the
data files (gshhs*.txt, countries*.txt, states*.txt and rivers*txt)
will be installed (see step 2 below).
Note: for this to work, matplotlib must also be installed in the same place
(via python setup.py install --home=<dir>).

2) download the basemap-data tarball, unpack and run "setup.py install"
This does not need to be done every time you update basemap (via step 1),
only when the basemap-data package is updated.

If you want the data files to be installed somewhere other than the 
default (sys.prefix/share/basemap), set the environment variable 
BASEMAP_DATA_PATH to the desired location. BASEMAP_DATA_PATH must then be 
set whenever basemap is imported in order for the package to locate the 
data files.
