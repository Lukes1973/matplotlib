**Documentation** 

see basemap.py docstrings.

see scripts in 'examples' directory for example usage.

read the FAQ and/or email the matplotlib-users mailing list if 
you have problems or questions.

**Install**

1) run 'python setup.py install' 

This installs the basemap package including the 
crude ('c') and low ('l') resolution boundary data files.
If you also want the intermediate and high resolution boundary
datasets, you'll also need step (2).

If you don't want the boundary data files to be installed in the 
default location (sys.prefix/share), set the BASEMAP_DATA_PATH
environment variable to where you would like them to go.  This
environment variable is also used at run-time to find the files.

2) if you need the intermediate ('i') or high ('h') resolution boundary 
datasets, download the basemap-data tarball, unpack and run "setup.py install"
This does not need to be done every time you update basemap (via step 1),
only when the basemap-data package is updated.
