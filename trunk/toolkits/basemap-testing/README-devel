To make a release:

1) check out a fresh copy from SVN.
2) run python setup.py sdist to make the source tarball.
3) run python setupegg.py bdist_egg to make a binary egg.
   (repeat this step on ppc mac, intel mac and windows, for
    python 2.4 and python 2.5).
   to create binary installers, run
   python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32 bdist_wininst on windows.
   bdist_mpkg (http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/bdist_mpkg/ on macos x.
4) put the *_h.txt boundary files in a tar.gz file
   (basemap-data-hires-X.Y.Z.tar.gz).
5) anon ftp the files files to SF
  local> cd dist
  local> ncftp upload.sourceforge.net
  ncftp> cd incoming
  ncftp> put tar.gz, *egg
6) go to https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/?group_id=80706 and do
   a file release.  Click on the "Admin" tab to log in as an admin,
   and then the "File Releases" tab.  Go to the bottom and click "add
   release" and enter the package name but not the version number in
   the "Package Name" box.  You will then be prompted for the "New
   release name" at which point you can add the version number, eg
   somepackage-0.1 and click "Create this release".

   You will then be taken to a fairly self explanatory page where you
   can enter the Change notes, the release notes, and select which
   packages from the incoming ftp archive you want to include in this
   release.  For each binary, you will need to select the platform and
   file type, and when you are done you click on the "notify users who
   are monitoring this package link"
