**Descripton**

basemap - plot on map projections (with coastlines and political boundaries)
using matplotlib.

**Requirements**

The GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) library (version 2.2.3 or higher).
Source code is included in the geos-2.2.3 directory.

PIL (http://pythonware.com/products/pil) is optional (only
needed for Basemap warpimage and bluemarble methods).

included in the 'geos-2.2.3' directory under the terms given in
LICENSE_geos.

pyshapelib by Bernhard Herzog is included in the 'pyshapelib' directory
under the terms given in LICENSE_pyshapelib.

the coastline, lake, river and political boundary data are extracted
from datasets provided with the Generic Mapping Tools
(http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu)
and are included under the terms given in LICENSE_data.

a public domain 5-minute land/sea/lake mask dataset from
http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/cdroms/graham/graham/graham.htm

see scripts in 'examples' directory for example usage.

read the FAQ and/or email the matplotlib-users mailing list if 
you have problems or questions.

**Install**

0) Install pre-requisite python modules numpy and matplotlib.

1) Then download basemap-X.Y.Z.tar.gz (approx 100 mb) from
the sourceforge download site, unpack and cd to basemap-X.Y.Z.

2) Install the GEOS library.  If you already have it on your
system, just set the environment variable GEOS_DIR to point to the location 
of libgeos_c and geos_c.h (if libgeos_c is in /usr/local/lib and
geos_c.h is in /usr/local/include, set GEOS_DIR to /usr/local).
Then go to step (3).  If you don't have it, you can build it from
the source code included with basemap by following these steps:

 > cd geos-2.2.3
 > export GEOS_DIR=<where you want the libs and headers to go>
   A reasonable choice on a Unix-like system is /usr/local, or
   if you don't have permission to write there, your home directory.
 > ./configure --prefix=$GEOS_DIR 
 > make; make install

3) cd back to the top level basemap directory (basemap-X.Y.Z) and
run the usual 'python setup.py install'.  Check your installation
by running "from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap" at the python
prompt.

Basemap includes two auxilliary packages, pydap (http://pydap.org, just 
the client is included) and httplib2.  By default, setup.py checks to 
see if these are already installed, and if so does not try to overwrite 
them. If you get import errors related to either of these two packages, 
edit setup.cfg and set pydap and/or httplib2 to True to force 
installation of the included versions.

4) To test, cd to the examples directory and run 'python simpletest.py'.
To run all the examples (except those that have extra dependencies
or require an internet connection), execute 'python run_all.py'.
