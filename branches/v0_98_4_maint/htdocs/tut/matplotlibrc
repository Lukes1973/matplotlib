#### MATPLOTLIBRC FORMAT 
#
# This is a sample matplotlib configuration file It should be placed
# in your home dir (Linux and friends) or in the matplotlib data path,
# is, where matplotlib installs it's data files (fonts, etc).  On
# windows, this would be, for example, C:\Python23\share\matplotlib
#
# By default, the installer will overwrite the existing file in the
# install path, so if you want to preserve your's, please move it to
# your HOME dir and set the environment variable if necessary.
#
# This file is best viewed in a editor which supports python mode
# syntax highlighting
#
# Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment symbol, are ignored,
# as are trailing comments.  Other lines must have the format
#
#   key : val   # optional comment
#
# Colors: for the color values below, you can either use 
#  - a matplotlib color string, such as r, k, or b
#  - an rgb tuple, such as (1.0, 0.5, 0.0)
#  - a hex string, such as ff00ff  (no '#' symbol)
#  - a scalar grayscale intensity such as 0.75

#### CONFIGURATION BEGINS HERE
backend      : Agg    # the default backend
numerix      : numpy   # Numeric or numarray
interactive  : False     # see http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/interactive.html

figure.figsize   : 6, 4    # figure size in inches
figure.dpi       : 80      # figure dots per inch
figure.facecolor : 0.75    # figure facecolor; 0.75 is scalar gray
figure.edgecolor : w       # figure edgecolor; w is white
 
### SAVING FIGURES
# the default savefig params can be different for the GUI backends.
# Eg, you may want a higher resolution, or to make the figure
# background white
savefig.dpi       : 72      # figure dots per inch
savefig.facecolor : w        # figure facecolor; 0.75 is scalar gray
savefig.edgecolor : w        # figure edgecolor; w is white
