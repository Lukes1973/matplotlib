<h2>Matlab(TM) compatible commands</h2>

Matplotlib provides a number of matlab compatible plotting commands.
In addition to these, a large number of matlab compatible commands are
provided by numpy. Below is a (growing) list of matlab compatible
commands.<p>

In addition, <a href=http://www.scipy.org/>scipy</a> provides many
more commands, but due to it's size, I haven't committed yet to making
it a requirement for matplotlib.<p>
