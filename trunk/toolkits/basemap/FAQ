Q: I get all kinds of errors when I try to create a Basemap class instance, 
what should I do?

A: Make sure that matplotlib is using numarray instead of Numeric.  This
can be done by running your script with "--numarray" on the command
line, or by setting numerix='numarray' in your matplotlibrc file.

Q: It takes forever to make a plot with the 'intermediate' resolution
coastlines, how can I speed it up?

A: Basemap is not very intelligent right now in the way that it processes
coastline data - it processes the data for the whole world regardless of
the region that your are trying to display.  If you are making many maps
for the same region, you only need to create you Basemap class instance
once, then re-use it for each plot.  If the plots are being created by
different scripts, you can save the Basemap class instance to a Pickle on
disk, then read it in whatever script needs it (it's much faster to read
a pickle from disk than it is to create the Basemap instance originally).
The ireland.py example illustrates how to do this.

Q: I have my own boundary dataset that I would like to use, how do I 
use it in place of (or in addition to) the built-in basemap boundary datasets?

A: If your dataset is in ESRI shapefile format, this is relatively easy.
Just create your Basemap class instance, then call the 'readshapefile' 
method on that instance to import your data.  Setting 'drawbounds=True' will 
draw the boundaries in the shapefile.  The plotclimdivs.py example
shows how to do this.
