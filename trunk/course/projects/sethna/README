Changes notes
=============

C. Myers is interested in improvements to their code.  Let's keep track here
of what why we do certain things, to have a mini-changelog for them later.

- Use docstrings with the first line being non-empty, and non-continuing.
Many automated tools extract the first docstring line for library summaries.

- the args=() trick is very non-standard.  Better use *args if needed.  But
the logistic map examples are much more cleanly done via a closure or a
callable class.

- Instead of scipy.arange, use pylab.frange.  It's easier to use, the npts
parameter makes it clearer in most cases, and it defaults to closed intervals
so there's no need to have warnings about edge effects.
